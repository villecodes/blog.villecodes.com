# 2019-11-26 - (Mini post) My personal tech-stack.

## Foreword
The tech stack that you use does 90% of times NOT matter. This is just my personal list of technologies that i use. 

## The list
1. VueJS - My go-to frontend library.
2. Express - The backend web framework I use for nearly all of my apps.
3. Vuepress - The best blog / documentation engine I have ever used, it actually powers this blog!
4. TailwindCSS - The best css framework I have ever used. It doesn't use already made classes like bootstrap, instead it has small classes that for example changes only the width.
